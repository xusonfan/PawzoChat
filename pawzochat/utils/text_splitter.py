# [语音]/[voice] marker with an optional -emotion suffix. Tolerates fullwidth
# brackets, in-marker spaces and long-dash variants (models frequently emit
# them under temperature sampling; paired dashes like [——]/[--] are accepted).
# Three hard constraints on the emotion capture:
# - Must not be letters-only: an invalid emotion such as [语音-开心] must still
#   match as a marker (emotion cleared, synthesis proceeds), otherwise the whole
#   marker degrades to plain text;
# - Must exclude whitespace and be length-capped: allowing whitespace/unbounded
#   capture makes "[语音-" + a long whitespace run backtrack catastrophically
#   (measured O(n^3)), and malformed markers like [语音-happy 正文] would
#   swallow body text into the emotion and silently delete it — such malformed
#   shapes should fail to match entirely and fall back to plain text;
# - Only spaces/tabs inside the marker, every quantifier with a small constant
#   bound: unbounded quantifiers, even non-overlapping ones, still leave O(n^2)
#   backtracking room on long whitespace runs.
