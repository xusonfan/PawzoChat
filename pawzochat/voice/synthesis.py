"""Voice-reply synthesis helper.

Triggered by [语音]/[voice] markers in the reply text (see
:func:`pawzochat.utils.text_splitter.parse_voice_reply`): provider resolution
→ voice fallback → TTS synthesis → duration probe → persist to disk. Any
failure returns ``None`` with a warning logged, and the caller degrades that
voice run into a regular text message.
